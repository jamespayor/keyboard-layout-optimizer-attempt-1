Optimal Keyboard Layout
==================================

My attempts to find an optimal keyboard layout for a coding-heavy workload.

The main point of interest is the cost function for a given layout, that estimates typing strain. The rest of the code is for manipulating layouts and simulated-annealing-esque optimization of keyboard layouts.

The code isn't very usable - this may be fixed at a later point or in a newer repository.
